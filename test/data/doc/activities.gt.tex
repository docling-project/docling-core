\subsection{Let's swim!}

To get started with swimming, first lay down in a water and try not to drown:

\begin{itemize}
\item ∞ You can relax and look around
\item ∞ Paddle about
\item ∞ Enjoy summer warmth
\end{itemize}

Also, don't forget:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1. Wear sunglasses
\item 2. Don't forget to drink water
\item 3. Use sun cream
\end{itemize}

Hmm, what else…

\begin{itemize}
\item -Another activity item
\item -Yet another one
\item -Stopping it here
\end{itemize}

Some text.

\begin{itemize}
\item -Starting the next page with a list item.
\item -Second item.
\end{itemize}
