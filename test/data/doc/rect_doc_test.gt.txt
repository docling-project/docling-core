First, car buyers - whether  private, fleet or business - are assumed to choose smaller cars instead of larger ones.  This is simulated in UKTCM by phasing out the sale of new large cars (engine size  >2.0 litres) by 2020 - starting in 2010, with linear interpolation between 2010 and  2020. Secondly, the tendency towards less overall car use and the increased  membership of car clubs for use of a variety of types of cars for longer distance  journeys is modelled endogenously in UKTCM by assuming significantly lower levels  of maximum car ownership per household in urban and non-urban areas - about half  of the reference value (TCM REF) for households owning ‘at least 2 cars’ and ‘at least</text>
