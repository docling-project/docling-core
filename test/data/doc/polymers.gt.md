## Physical and Chemical Properties Relevant to Food Packaging

- **Barrier to gases and moisture**
    - Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) – how much O₂ passes per square meter per hour.
    - Carbon‑dioxide transmission rate (CO₂TR) – how much CO₂ permeates.
    - Water‑vapor transmission rate (WVTR) – amount of moisture that diffuses.
    - Influence of polymer crystallinity, copolymer composition, and barrier additives on all three rates.
- **Tensile strength**
    - Tensile modulus (MPa) – stiffness of the material.
    - Elongation at break (%) – flexibility before failure.
    - Standard test conditions (temperature, strain rate) that determine the reported values.
- **Heat resistance**
    - Glass transition temperature (Tg) – the temperature at which the polymer softens.
    - Heat deflection temperature (HDT) – the temperature at which it bends under load.
    - Thermal degradation onset temperature – the point where chemical breakdown starts.
    - Suitability for microwave, oven, or sterilization processes.
- **Chemical stability**
    - Resistance to acids, bases, and organic solvents used in food processing.
    - Oxidative stability – how well the polymer resists free‑radical degradation.
    - Interaction with food constituents such as fatty acids, alcohols, and acids.
    - Impact on polymer aging and shelf‑life of packaged products.
- **Migration potential**
    - Results of migration tests (e.g., extraction of additives or additives’ leaching).
    - Compliance with regulatory limits (e.g., EU Directive 10/2011, FDA food‑contact legislation).
    - Effect of temperature, time, and food type on the amount of material that migrates.
    - Barrier performance against the migration of contaminants or degradation products.

## Safety and Regulatory Considerations

**Common migration testing methods**

- **Extraction in food simulants**
    - *What it is* : Samples of the packaging material are immersed in a liquid that mimics the chemical properties of a specific food type (e.g., aqueous, acidic, fatty).
    - *Typical simulants* :
        - 3% acetic acid (for acidic foods)
        - 50% ethanol (for alcohol‑based foods)
        - 95% ethanol (for high‑fat foods)
        - Distilled water (for aqueous foods)
    - *Procedure* :
        - Prepare a defined volume of simulant in a sealed vessel.
        - Immerse the material for a set time at a controlled temperature (often 50 °C–70 °C).
        - Remove, filter, and concentrate the extract for analysis.
    - *Analysis* : GC‑MS, LC‑MS, or HPLC depending on the analyte class.
    - *Advantages* : Direct assessment of potential migration into a realistic medium; scalable for routine testing.
    - *Limitations* : Does not account for headspace gas migration; may underestimate migration of highly volatile substances.
- **Headspace analysis**
    - *What it is* : Measurement of volatile substances that migrate from the material into the surrounding gas phase.
    - *Procedure* :
        - Seal the material in a headspace vial or chamber.
        - Equilibrate at a defined temperature (commonly 25 °C–60 °C).
        - Sample the gas phase with a gas sampling needle or syringe.
        - Analyze via GC‑FID, GC‑MS, or PTR‑MS.
    - *Applications* : Assessment of aromas, flavor compounds, or volatile contaminants.
    - *Advantages* : Sensitive to low‑concentration volatiles; minimal sample preparation.
    - *Limitations* : Does not capture non‑volatile migration; results depend on equilibrium time and temperature.
- **Direct contact tests**
    - *What it is* : The packaging material is placed in direct contact with the food or food simulant, often using a defined food‑packaging configuration.
    - *Procedure* :
        - Assemble the material and food (or simulant) in a mold or container that simulates real usage (e.g., sealed pouch, jar).
        - Incubate for the intended storage time at the relevant temperature.
        - Extract or sample the food directly (e.g., through the material or by taking a portion of the food).
        - Analyze for migrated substances.
    - *Advantages* : Mimics real consumer exposure; captures both liquid and vapor migration pathways.
    - *Limitations* : More labor‑intensive; requires careful control of contact area, thickness, and sealing integrity.

These three approaches—extraction in food simulants, headspace analysis, and direct contact tests—complement each other to provide a comprehensive assessment of potential migration from packaging into food.

    - Energy usage for manufacturing, transportation, and daily activities
    - Water consumption in agriculture, industry, and household use
    - Extraction of raw materials (mining, drilling, logging)
    - Associated carbon emissions and climate impact
- **Landfill waste**
    - Rapid growth in waste volume due to population and consumption increases
    - Methane production from decomposing organic matter
    - Leachate generation that can contaminate soil and groundwater
    - Limited landfill space leading to overburdened disposal sites
- **Plastic pollution**
    - Accumulation of large‑scale debris in oceans and rivers
    - Formation of microplastics that enter the food chain
    - Low recycling rates and inefficient waste separation
    - Prevalence of single‑use plastics contributing to ongoing litter
