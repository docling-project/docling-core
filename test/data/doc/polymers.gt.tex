\item Standard test conditions (temperature, strain rate) that determine the reported values.
  \end{itemize}
\item 
\textbf{Heat resistance}
  \begin{itemize}
\item Glass transition temperature (Tg) – the temperature at which the polymer softens.
\item Heat deflection temperature (HDT) – the temperature at which it bends under load.
